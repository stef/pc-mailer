Howdy my friend,

To establish some kind of mathematical trust between us, I want to share a
password with you. But I want this a bit more securely, than our unencrypted
emailing now. Please go to {{buddyurl}} - if your browser complains about
"untrusted hosts or connections" - don't worry now, this is normal, we'll sort
this out later, just ignore the warnings and click your way through the
warnings.

When you're done there, reply to this email so we can work out the next steps.

I'm soo excited! I feel we'll be a great team!
cheers,
Ono
